Aim: Make some changes to RADIAN based on user feedback (me ;-) ) from
extensive use of tool during CS621. Some suggested changes:
- allow all columns to be optional – but also allow for multiple columns of
the same type (for example two timestamp columns)
- Allow extraction from a file but without weights
- Potentially allow for some ‘patterns’ to drive generation of randomised
strings.
- Allow export of the Voroni polygons to GeoJSON and/or PostgreSQL Dump
file?
- More detailed analysis on the critical point for RADIAN – at what scale does
the generation start to “not be realistic”
